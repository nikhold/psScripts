The following is a description of each script contained in this folder:


randomPasswordGenerator.ps1 - 

This is a script that generates random, secure passwords. It first prompts the user for required length, and 
then whether special characters are allowed or not. After gathering user input, the script will generate 
at least one number, lowercase and uppercase letter, and special character if required. It will then combine 
these characters, and randomly generate the remaining characters from a combined pool of all numbers, letters and their case,
and special characters if required. It will then randomize the order of these characters to ensure randomness. After 
password is shown, and the user acknowledges they are ready to continue, the generated password is deleted off the 
system so that it may not be accessed later. It is HIGHLY recommended that you write the generated password
down on paper so that you do not forget it.


backuproutmk3_pub.ps1 - 

This is a script I use to mirror user files to USB Drives. This is done manually, so files can be safely 
retrieved if accidently deleted. This one is interactive, as it will prompt the user for the folder they 
would like to copy, as well as display size information and retry requests once finished or if a folder
wasn't found. 
DISCLAIMER: This script needs to be configured before use, as some values had to be altered for anonymity.
Please read the comments throughout the script very carefully, and they should be able to guide you on what
you need to change.


maintenanceReport.ps1 - 

This is a script that grabs system data, such as OS version, time, drive health, etc. and formats it into a 
nice, readable text. Users also have the option of creating a .log file should they want to retain any info.
The script will check for a "Reports folder, and create one if not. It will then create the .log file in that folder.
