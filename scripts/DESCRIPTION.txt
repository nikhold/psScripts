The following is a description of each script contained in this folder:


randomPasswordGenerator.ps1 - 

This is a script that generates random, secure passwords. It first prompts the user for required length, and 
then whether special characters are allowed or not. After gathering user input, the script will generate 
at least one number, lowercase and uppercase letter, and special character if required. It will then combine 
these characters, and randomly generate the remaining characters from a combined pool of all numbers, letters and their case,
and special characters if required. It will then randomize the order of these characters to ensure randomness. After 
password is shown, and the user acknowledges they are ready to continue, the generated password is deleted off the 
system so that it may not be accessed later. It is HIGHLY recommended that you write the generated password
down on paper so that you do not forget it.
